# Visual Assessment of Graph Sampling
This is a visual assessment system of graph sampling that I completed with other team members during the summer vacation of my freshman year. In this practice, my seniors has given our group great help, and here I express my heartfelt thanks.

The visualization evaluation system of graph sampling mainly judges the preservation of local and global topological features of original graph data through the result of graph sampling, and visualizes the evaluation and presentation of graph sampling algorithm.

In this system, the main visualization views include map layout of network graph data, scatter plot of t-SEN dimension reduction projection, radar map of sampling algorithm evaluation summary, matrix chart of judging the retention of sampling results to the original data topological features, etc.

This summer practice has brought me great benefits. Thanks very much for the guidance of Mr. Zhou and the help of my seniors and other members of my group.
